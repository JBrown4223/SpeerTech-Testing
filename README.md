<h3> Twitter-Like App</h3>

<p>For this app I wasn't able to build architecture for the chat portion. I wasn't comfortable with what I was readng in various documentation so I opted to 
leave it out. I was able to create a setup for users to update, delete, and retweet which I am happy with. </p>

<p> My goal was to make an api that would maximize creativity of the front-end. Things like threading can be done easily on the client-side because and linked tweets would indicate that they are linked, simmilar to linked list. I also made sure that each route after login is authorized by JWT - see isAuth function in middleware.js</p>

<h3>Stock Trading App</h3>

<p> For this app I used the same style of restriction, authorizing access to other parts of the server using JWT. I was unable top find a good endpoint to load stock quotes. The ones i did find where more focused on giving you bid and ask numbers, candlsticks, and percentage leaders/laggers, I'll probably make one for my next solo project</p>

<p> All and all I hope you see potential in my work, I know it is with blemmishes, but I'm confident I have a good foundation</p>
